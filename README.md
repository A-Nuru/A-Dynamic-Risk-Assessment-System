# A-Dynamic-Risk-Assessment-System
## Overview
As a consulting company offering operational and data consulting to clients, there is extreme concern about 
attrition risk: the risk that some of our clients will exit their contracts and decrease the company's revenue. 
Due to the small client management team, client managers are not able to stay in close contact with all of the clients.
Therefore, there is need to estimate the attrition risk of each of the company's clients.
Thus, the task is to create, deploy, and monitor a risk assessment ML model that will estimate the attrition 
risk of each of the company's clients. This will enable the 
client managers to contact the clients with the highest risk and avoid losing clients and revenue.
